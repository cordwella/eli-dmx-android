# ELi-DMX Android App

This is an android client for the [ELi-DMX lighting control server](https://github.com/cordwella/eli-dmx-server-side). More information is avaliable on that github page.

This has been superseeded by the new version ["ELi-DMX"](http://www.github.com/cordwella/eli-dmx), which runs as a web app instead, I would recomend using that one.


Thank you to my friend Lana for doing the logos (and no it doesn't need to be shifted one pixel to the right).
