# ELi-DMX Android App

This is an android client for the [ELi-DMX lighting control server](https://github.com/cordwella/eli-dmx-server-side). More information is avaliable on that github page.

Thank you to my friend Lana for doing the logos (and no it doesn't need to be shifted one pixel to the right).
